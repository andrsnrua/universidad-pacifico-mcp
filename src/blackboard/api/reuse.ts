/**
 * Stops us asking the university the same thing twice.
 *
 * This is the half of "healthy traffic" that costs the student nothing. Pacing
 * makes requests slower; this makes them not happen. An assistant answering
 * "what do I have this week?" calls list_assignments and then get_grades, and
 * both fetch the same gradebook columns; asked about feedback, it fans out over
 * every assignment in the course. Much of that is the identical GET, seconds
 * apart, inside one conversation.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, both invisible:
 *
 * - Coalescing: two identical GETs in flight at once become one request and
 *   share the answer. Always safe, since they would have returned the same
 *   thing anyway.
 * - A short memory: a repeated GET within a few seconds is answered from the
 *   last response. Short on purpose — long enough to cover one conversation,
 *   too short to show a grade that changed while the student was looking.
 *
 * Anything that writes clears the memory, so "did my submission go through?"
 * asked right after submitting never reads a stale answer.
